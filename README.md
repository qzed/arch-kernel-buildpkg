# Linux Surface Kernel Packaging Helpers

Heavily customized.
May not work for you or need adaptions.

Provides `kpgk.py` scripts for creating clean Arch Linux and Debian kernel
packages using a previously checked out git source tree. Debian packages are
built over SSH on a LXC container. Arch Linux packages are directly built on
the host.  Refer to the respective scripts for more information.
